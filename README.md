# LoLUpdater v1.3.1 for OS X
## How to use
[Download](https://github.com/davidkna/LoLUpdater/archive/master.zip) and run `LoLUpdater.command` (you might need to `right-click` or `ctrl` + `left-click` the file and select `open` for Gatekeeper), if you want to revert the changes run `Restore.command`. I suggest to close LoL before starting the patch. The script will require your password.
## If you haven't installed LoL at default location...
If you haven't installed LoL at `/Applications/League of Legends.app`, place it in the Applicaiton root to run. Google if you don't know how to get there. Backups are stored there as well.
## Updates
You may have to restore for updates to work correctly.
## What does it do?
LoLUpdater will update the internal depencies Nvidia Cg, Adobe Air, Bugsplat (bug reporter), libc++ and libc++abi. This will improve performance for you and in case you want to revert the changes the script creates backups of the old files.
## Other recommendations
Download a Windows font pack. Your eyes will thank you.
